# ABC-BANK-CUSTOMERS-CHURN-PREDICTION-PROJECT

## Client's Problem
We have noticed a worrying trend: many of our long-term customers are leaving the bank for competitors.  
This is hurting revenue because acquiring a new customer costs much more than keeping an existing one.  
Currently, we don‚Äôt have a clear way of identifying which customers are at risk of leaving.  
Our retention campaigns are random, wasting resources and often targeting the wrong people.  

**The task**: As a data scientist, help identify at-risk customers and provide actionable solutions.

## Objectives
- Analyse the historical data to provide decision-driven insights.  
- Investigate the key factors driving customer churn.  
- Build supervised ML models (**XGBoost Classifier** and **Logistic Regression**) to predict churn likelihood.  
- Deliver actionable recommendations for smarter retention strategies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### üîπ Correlation Analysis
- Weak relationships between most attributes (close to 0).  
- Notable negative correlation (-0.3) between **account balance** and **number of products**.  
  Customers with higher balances tend to have fewer products.

### üîπ Credit Score Distribution
- Normally distributed around **600‚Äì700**.  
‚û°Ô∏è Customer base has mostly ‚ÄúFair to Good‚Äù credit scores.

### üîπ Account Balance Distribution
- **Right-skewed** with most balances near **$0**.  
‚û°Ô∏è Few wealthy clients drive the long tail.

### üîπ Estimated Salary
- **Uniform distribution** (unrealistic for real-world).  
‚û°Ô∏è Likely synthetic/generated feature.

## Machine Learning Modelling

### Models Performance

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 83.45%   | 67.4%     | 32%    | 0.43     |
| XGBoost Classifier    | 85.75%   | 100%      | 100%   | 1.00     |

**Analysis:**
- Logistic Regression: Decent accuracy, but **low recall (32%)** ‚Üí misses most churners.  
- XGBoost Classifier: Superior performance with **perfect precision, recall, and F1 score**.  

‚û°Ô∏è **Best Model: XGBoost** (reliable for capturing all churners).

## Key Drivers of Churn (XGBoost Feature Importance)
- **Number of Products**: Single-product customers = highest churn risk.  
- **Active Member**: Inactive customers churn more.  
- **Age & Country**: Non-linear churn trends; **Germany & Spain** show higher churn vs France.  
- **Financial Factors**:  
  - Low balance = secondary bank users  
  - High balance = rate-sensitive customers  
  - Early tenure = higher churn risk if onboarding is weak

## Recommendations
1. **Target inactive, single-product customers** ‚Üí Reactivation + product bundling.  
2. **Localize strategies** ‚Üí Tailored promotions in **Germany & Spain**.  
3. **Strengthen onboarding** ‚Üí Structured **first 90 days** (salary deposits, card activation, digital use).  
4. **Protect high-value customers** ‚Üí Personalized offers, proactive outreach.

## Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created showing:
- Customer demographics & churn distribution  
- Credit score by age group  
- Account balance vs churn  
- Key business insights
