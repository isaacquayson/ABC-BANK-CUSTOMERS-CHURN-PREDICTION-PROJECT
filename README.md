# ABC-BANK-CUSTOMERS-CHURN-PREDICTION-PROJECT

## Client's Problem
We have noticed a worrying trend: many of our long-term customers are leaving the bank for competitors.  
This is hurting revenue because acquiring a new customer costs much more than keeping an existing one.  
Currently, we don‚Äôt have a clear way of identifying which customers are at risk of leaving.  
Our retention campaigns are random, wasting resources and often targeting the wrong people.  

**The task**: As a data scientist, help identify at-risk customers and provide actionable solutions.
